# FastRSF
A fast implementation of Random Survival Forests inspired by Scikit-Survival but without Sklearn's tree implementation.
Very much WIP so far, but currently [example_use.py](example_use.py) shows how to use it, and [compare.py](compare.py) shows how basic
performance compares to scikit-survival. Memory usage seems much lower, but speed is not yet as good, at least for this toy example.
